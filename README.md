_by setghm_

This is a Flappy Bird-like game that runs in the legacy Windows Command Prompt (aka CMD)

![flappy-bird-cmd-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac77e01-1dbf-4417-8d37-640483c88b8d)


The project is a Visual Studio C++ project, so you can build it using that IDE (tested in Visual Studio 2022).

All images used in this game are color matrices with values ​​accepted by the Windows Command Prompt (numbers from 0 to 16).
All of them were created using my own CMDPaint application, you can see it [here](https://github.com/setghm/CMDPaint).


> [!NOTE]
> The game must be run from its working directory, otherwise the assets folder will not be found and the game will crash on startup.
>
> You will also need to have the **Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime** installed to run the game.

### **Enjoy!**
